## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">
Hi, I'm Felix. I grew up in Tübingen, then studied Computer Science B.Sc in Jena, Germany. I'm interested in all kinds of social and innovative apps and games. There is is a huge untapped well of social potential left in it. **I have set myself the goal to dig some of it up.**

Here are some of my projects.

## Projects and Experiences

### 💡 Apps for HEAVN GmbH

HEAVN builds human centric desk lamps. I helped them build Apps for Android and iOS. The Apps are native and communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy to the Lamp using a GATT UART Service.

### Help Jack finally fulfill his Role as Caretaker
Play this cool game where you get to kill a boy with an axe. Find your way through a mythological maze and stand the freezing cold of the Colorado winter. Shine in the role as Jack and help him finally carry out his duty as a good Caretaker.

A game I created with my [brother](https://twitter.com/valentinbaral).

## Publication

During my Bachelor I occupied myself a lot with mechanics of F2P-games. I wrote a small article abut F2P anti-patterns in the [FifF 2/2017](https://www.fiff.de/publikationen/fiff-kommunikation/fk-2017/fk-2017-2).
