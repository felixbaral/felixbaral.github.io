### Help Jack finally fulfill his Role as Caretaker
Play this cool game where you get to kill a boy with an axe. Find your way through a mythological maze and stand the freezing cold of the Colorado winter. Shine in the role as Jack and help him finally carry out his duty as a good Caretaker.

A game I created with my brother.
